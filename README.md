# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was developed to be an inventory app with the goal of keeping track of the user items and inventory. It is hopefully going to help business owners keep track of there inventorys 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Screens for this app we needed 4 in order to make the experience good for the user. It had a login screen so that the user can login into there account on the app. It needed a screen that displyed the inventory, plus a screen to add or edit the inventory. For user I kept the design very simple and easy to use so that they could pick up the application quickly and get the benefits from it. 

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I coded the app by first understanding what it needed to do and planning how the screens should look. I followed coding standards, used version control to track changes, and tested the app to catch and fix any issues. The same techniques could be applied to any future coding problem the biggest difference between the app and other projects I have worked on would be the UI desgin. The coding part was just like anyother coding part.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

This was very intresting because when it came to testing the appication was very different from other development projects that I have done. So with most of my other projects I have worked when I finished debugging the code it would usually work. With the app I had to do so much more debugging while the code would build with no errors the way it would interact with the UI was terrible. So the process of actually testing your code in mobile development was very important.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

To be honest I dont think I was particualy componet on any of the points in this project I really think that I underestimated how much code needed to be written in order to make an app run the way you were expecting. 

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to add an extra screen in order to make the add item work smoothly with the project I had to add a extra screen for users to type in the name description and number of the item.
